#### Problem 1 - Objective Function

Before you set up the optimization problem in your spreadsheet software (Excel or other), we will walk you through the formulation.

Note: The (c_ij\*x_kj + c_ij\*x_kj + ... + c_ij\*x_kj) term is the SUMPRODUCT of the 1x5 cost block of the ith option and jth day and the 1x5 x variables of the kth event on day j.

For example, (c_11\*x_11 + c_12\*x_12 + ... + c_15\*x_15) is the SUMPRODUCT of company A's cost per meal during the week and the amount purchased from company A for the morning events.

Which of the following is a correct expression for the catering company's revenue? Define this expression to be the revenue.


- (c_11\*x_11 + c_12\*x_12 + ... + c_15\*x_15) + (c_11\*y_11 + c_12\*y_12 + ... + c_15\*y_15) + (c_11\*z_11 + c_12\*z_12 + ... + c_15\*z_15)
- **8\*((x_11 + x_12 + ... + x_15 + x_21 + x_22 + ... x_25) + (y_11 + y_12 + ... + y_15 + y_21 + y_22 + ... y_25) + (z_11 + z_12 + ... + z_15 + z_21 + z_22 + ... z_25))**
- 4\*(x_11 + x_12 + ... + x_15 + x_21 + x_22 + ... x_25) + 3\*(y_11 + y_12 + ... + y_15 + y_21 + y_22 + ... y_25) + 2\* (z_11 + z_12 + ... + z_15 + z_21 + z_22 + ... z_25)
- 4\*(x_11 + x_12 + ... + x_15 + x_21 + x_22 + ... x_25) + 3\*(y_11 + y_12 + y_13 + y_21 + y_22 + y_23) + 5\*(y_14 + y_15 + y_24 + y_25) + 2\* (z_11 + z_12 + ... + z_15 + z_21 + z_22 + ... z_25)

Which of the following is a correct expression for the catering company's costs? Define this expression to be the cost.


- (c_11\*x_11 + c_12\*x_12 + ... + c_15\*x_15) + (c_11\*y_11 + c_12\*y_12 + ... + c_15\*y_15) + (c_11*z_11 + c_12\*z_12 + ... + c_15\*z_15)
- (c_31\*z_11 + c_32\*z_22 + ... + c_35\*z_15) + (c_31\*z_21 + c_32\*y_22 + ... + c_35\*z_25)
- (c_11\*x_11 + c_12\*x_12 + ... + c_15\*x_15) + (c_11\*y_11 + c_12\*y_12 + ... + c_15\*y_15) + (c_11*z_11 + c_12\*z_12 + ... + c_15\*z_15) + (c_11\*x_21 + c_12\*x_22 + ... + c_15\*x_25) + (c_11\*y_21 + c_12\*y_22 + ... + c_15\*y_25) + (c_11\*z_21 + c_12\*z_22 + ... + c_15\*z_25)
- **(c_11\*x_11 + c_12\*x_12 + ... + c_15\*x_15) + (c_11\*x_21 + c_12\*x_22 + ... + c_15\*x_25) + (c_21\*y_11 + c_22\*y_12 + ... + c_25\*y_15) + (c_21\*y_21 + c_22\*y_22 + ... + c_25\*y_25) +(c_31\*z_11 + c_32\*z_12 + ... + c_35\*z_15) + (c_31\*z_21 + c_32\*z_22 + ... + c_35\*z_25)**

Which of the following is a correct expression for the objective function?

- maximize cost - revenue
- **maximize revenue - cost**
- minimize revenue + cost
- minimize revenue - cost

Under the assumption that there is a feasible solution, will the objective value of this function ever be negative?

- Yes, it is possible that that the cost will be higher than the revenue.
- **No, regardless of the decisions taken by the model, the catering company profits from every individual meal.**
- There is not enough information.

#### Problem 2.1: Constraints

Let's organize our constraints in the following list:

- Company B cannot provide more than 50 meals per event

- The catering company cannot cook more than 55 meals per event

- The catering company cannot cook more than 100 meals per day

- Each amount chosen to be purchased/cooked is nonnegative

- x_ij + y_ij + z_ij = a_ij for every i = 1,2 and j = 1,...5 where a_ij is the demand for event i on day j

How many constraints does this list correspond to?

**65**

Which of the following is the correct constraint for "Company B cannot provide more than 50 meals on Monday for the morning event"?

- x_11 is less than or equal to 50
- c_11 * y_11 is less than or equal to 50
- **y_11 is less than or equal to 50**
- y_11 is greater than or equal to 50

Which of the following is the correct constraint for "the catering company cannot cook more than 55 meals on Monday for the evening event"?


- z_11 + z_21 is less than or equal to 55
- z_21 + y_21 + x_21 is less than or equal to 55
- **z_21 is less than or equal to 55**
- z_21 is equal to 55

Which of the following is the correct constraint for "the catering company cannot cook more than 100 meals on Monday"?


- z_11 is less than or equal to 100
- **z_11 + z_21 is less than or equal to 100**
- z_21 + y_21 + x_21 is less than or equal to 100
- c_21 \* x_21 + c_21 \* y_21 + c_21 \* z_21 is less than or equal to 100

#### Problem 2.2: Constraints (cont'd)

Let's observe the last two constraints:

- Each amount chosen to be purchased/cooked is nonnegative

- x_ij + y_ij + z_ij = a_ij for every i = 1,2 and j = 1,...5 where a_ij is the demand for event i on day j

Why do we constrain the amounts being served to be nonnegative? Select the best explanation.


- No reason, this is a redundant constraint in the model
- **By definition, these variables are nonnegative - it is not possible to cook or purchase negative numbers of meals**
- Because all variables should be nonnegative

Why do we constrain the sum of amounts being served at each event to be equal to the demand? Select the best explanation.

- No reason, this is a redundant constraint in the model
- Because all variable that are fractions need to sum up to one.
- **There will be no revenue for any meal served that was not requested. Therefore, the catering company must restrict itself to serve the exact amount requested.**

If we change the last constarint to be "less than or equal to the demand" instead of "equal to the demand", will this affect the optimal value of the model?

- **No, since the catering company profits from each unit of dish served, it will maximize the amount of dishes to always serve the amount requested.**
- Yes, this will allow the catering company the option of not serving all of the meals requested.
- There is not enough information.


#### Problem 3 - Sanity Check

As you set up your model, it may be helpful to check that the output is what you expect before submitting your answers. Answer the following before setting up your model to check your understanding.

How many attendees (meals) are expected in the upcoming week?

**885**

Ignoring the constraints, assume the catering company chooses to cook all of the meals for the upcoming week. What is the objective value in such a scenario? Denote this solution to be the cooking solution and the value to be the cooking value.

**5310**  
 
Returning to our original problem which includes all of the constraints formulated, is the cooking solution feasible?


- Yes
- **No**
- Not enough information

Assuming there exists a feasible solution to our original problem, will the optimal revenue be higher than that of the cooking value?

- Yes
- **No**
- Not enough information
 
#### Problem 4 - Solving the Model

Formulate the model in LibreOffice/Excel and solve.

What is the optimal objective value?

**4435**

How many meals are being purchased from company B on Wednesday for the morning event?

**50**

Out of all the meals being cooked on Friday, the catering company wants to cook the maximum amount of meals for the evening event. Note that the catering company is still contrained to 55 meals per event.

Given this preference and the optimal objective value, how many meals are being cooked by the catering company on Friday for the evening event?

**55**
 
#### Problem 5 - Sensitivity Analysis

Suppose the original price to cook a meal increases by $0.5.

How will this impact the amount of meals being cooked? Answer this without re-solving the model.


- **It will stay the same**
- It will be lower
- It could be either of the above

How will this impact the optimal objective value? Answer this without re-solving the model.

- It will stay the same
- **It will be lower**
- It could be either of the above
- Suppose the orginal price to cook a meal increases by $1.

How will this impact the amount of meals being cooked? Answer this without re-solving the model.

- It will stay the same
- It will be lower
- **It could be either of the above**

Suppose that the morning event on Monday requests an additional five meals at the last minute such that these meals cannot be purchased and must be cooked. Is the new problem feasible?


- **Yes**
- No
- Not
