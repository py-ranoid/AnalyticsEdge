#### Quick Question

In the previous video, we solved our optimization problem in LibreOffice. In your spreadsheet, change the demand for regular seats to 50 (cell D5). Then re-solve the model.

What is the new optimal objective value?

**58458**

Now change the demand of regular seats to 200. What is the new optimal objective value?

**102422**

#### Quick Question

Using the visualization we created in the previous video, answer the following questions:

Suppose that our demand for regular seats remains the same (100) but our demand for discount seats goes down to 100. Will our optimal solution change?

- Yes
- **No* correct**
- I can't answer this question using the visualization.

Now suppose that our demand for regular seats remains the same (100) but our demand for discount seats goes down to 50. Will our optimal solution change?

- **Yes**
- No
- I can't answer this question using the visualization.

#### Quick Question

In your spreadsheet, change the capacity to 250 in the capacity constraint, the regular demand to 150, and the discount demand to 150. Then re-solve the model.

What is the objective value of the optimal solution?

**116350**

#### Quick Question

In this quick question, we'll perform some sensitivity analysis on the connecting flights problem.

Previously, we said that American Airlines could market their fares to increase demand. It costs $200 in advertising to increase demand by one unit.

Is it worth it to market the discount fares from JFK to DFW?


- Yes. American Airlines should market the discount fares from JFK to DFW to increase demand by 50.
- Yes. American Airlines should market the discount fares from JFK to DFW to increase demand by 10.
- No. American Airlines should not market the discount fares from JFK to DFW because even though the revenue increases, it does not exceed the costs.
- **No. American Airlines should not market the discount fares from JFK to DFW because the revenue does not increase at all by increasing the demand for these tickets.**

Is it worth it to market the regular fares from JFK to LAX?

- Yes. American Airlines should market the regular fares from JFK to LAX to increase demand by 50.
- Yes. American Airlines should market the regular fares from JFK to LAX to increase demand by 10. incorrect
- **No. American Airlines should not market the regular fares from JFK to LAX because even though the revenue increases, it does not exceed the costs.**
- No. American Airlines should not market the regular fares from JFK to LAX because the revenue does not increase at all by increasing the demand for these tickets.

#### Quick Question

In our optimal solution, we are giving the maximum allowed dose to the spinal cord (5). If we were to relax this, how much could we decrease the objective? Change the right-hand-side (RHS) of the spinal cord constraint to 6, and re-solve the model. By how much did we decrease the objective? (Hint: the previous objective value was 22.75)

**0.583333363**

#### Quick Question

In the previous video, we discussed a Head and Neck case with 132,878 voxels total, 9,777 voxels in the tumor, and 328 beamlets.

How many decision variables does our optimization model have?

**328**

#### Quick Question

In your spreadsheet from Video 3, make sure that you have solved the original small example problem (change the spinal cord limit back to 5 and re-solve if you have changed it, and make sure the objective value is 22.75).

Now, change the weight for the spinal cord term in the objective to 5.

Without re-solving, what does the objective value of the current solution change to?

**42.75**

Now re-solve the model. What does the objective change to?

**25.66666667**
 
Notice how we are now giving a smaller dose to the spinal cord!
